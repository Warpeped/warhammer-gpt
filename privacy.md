# Privacy Policy for 40k Rules Aide

**Last Updated:** August 22, 2025

Thank you for using the 40k Rules Aide. This policy outlines how we handle your data when you use our GPT.

## 1. Data We Process
To provide the service, we process the following game-related information:
- **Army Roster Data:** This includes the names of your rosters and the names of the units you add to them.
- **Combat Simulation Data:** This includes the statistics you provide for simulating combat (e.g., number of attacks, skill, strength, toughness, and save values).
- **Game Commands:** This includes natural language instructions related to managing your roster or simulating battles.

## 2. How We Use Your Data
Your data is used exclusively to operate the Warhammer 40,000 assistant:
- **Army Roster Data** is used to create and display your army lists within the application.
- **Combat Simulation Data** is used to calculate the probable outcome of an attack sequence.
- **Game Commands** are sent to a third-party AI model (Groq) to understand your intent and perform the correct action.

## 3. Data Storage
Your army roster data is stored in a JSON file on our application server to provide memory between your interactions.

Please be aware that this storage is **not permanent**. The data in this file will be reset and permanently deleted whenever the application is redeployed or the server instance is refreshed. We do not have long-term access to your army rosters and do not create permanent backups.

## 4. Data Sharing
We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties, with one exception:
- Your natural language **game commands** are shared with our AI service provider (Groq) to interpret your instructions. Your specific army roster data is not shared with them.
